# Arkham City - Glitches

# Ground Takedown Cancels (AKA Quickfire Cancels)
You can cancel out of some animations (most notably **Ground Takedowns**) by mashing the **Quickfire Batclaw** (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton"> + <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Xbox_button_Y.svg" alt="Y" class="controllerButton">) inputs on controller. These can also be done as Catwoman with her whip, Robin with the zip kick, and Nightwing also with the Batclaw (same inputs for every character).

Things you can cancel:  
• Ground takedowns (specifically ones with Batman jumping into the air, which usually occur when you have a combo)  
• Aerial takedowns (this is not useful *or* recommended)  
• Riding TITANS (at any point)  

You can also spam other actions at the same time as Quickfire Batclaw, which allows you to do that action instead (though this guarantees that you will lose your combo). Confirmed things this can be done with:  
• Quickfire explosive gel  
• Dive-rolling  
• Quickfire REC  

# Door Cancelling (REC)  
You can interrupt the animation of opening a door by firing the REC at the same time as you open the door. To do this, hold forward on the Left Stick, then press and hold <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, then <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Xbox_Right_Trigger.svg" alt="Right Trigger" class="controllerButton"> (or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton">) and <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton">
 at the same time (keyboard inputs are the same timing, just with Right Click, Left Click/Middle Mouse Button, and Space).

In addition to interrupting door animations, this also works on the Jammers, the Bombs in *Harley Quinn's Revenge* (HQR), and various one-off animations throughout the game (none of which are beneficial to cancel).

# Door Cancelling (Alternate Fire)
There is another method of cancelling doors that can be done with any gadget that has an "alternate fire" function. The input sequence is very similar to cancelling with the REC, except that you *must* use <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton">, you don't need to hold forward, and the timing is *extremely* precise. To do this you must press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton">, and <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Right Click, Middle Mouse Button, Space) all on the same frame. This can be quite difficult (especially at 62fps), so don't be discouraged if it takes a long time to get used to the timing. If you're firing the gadget and not opening the door, you're pressing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Space) too late. If you're opening the door without using your gadget, you're either pressing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Space) too early or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton"> (Middle Mouse Button) too late.

Confirmed to work with these gadgets:  
• Batarang  
• Batclaw  
• REC  
• Smoke Pellet  
• Sonic Batarang  

# Direct Zips (AKA Corner Zips)
**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE**: Zips behave differently at different framerates. On PC, you’ll want to make sure the game is running at 62fps (default with V-Sync disabled) to be able to do the optimal route for every category. For console, the game is locked to 30fps, so make sure you’re referencing other console runs when learning zips, as many of the PC zips do not work on console due to the framerate.

Get into corner cover, pull out any gadget that you can aim in corner cover (we usually use the Batarang), then you want to aim with <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, let go of aim, hold aim with <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton"> again, and then press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Xbox_button_B.svg" alt="B" class="controllerButton">. If done correctly, the camera will swing off to the side. Then, simply use any projectile gadget and Batman will be launched. This also works on keyboard (**Right Click** and **Left Ctrl** respectively), and it's recommended that you do this on keyboard if you have the option as it it both easier and slightly faster.

This works with all of the following gadgets (note that the timing is a bit different for different gadgets):  
• Batarang  
• Batclaw (setup only)  
• REC  
• Freeze Grenade  
• Smoke Pellet  
• Sonic Batarang  
• Line Launcher (setup only)  
• Disruptor (setup only)  
• Freeze Mine  
• RC Batarang  

# Storage (Overview)
Any time you **aim** or **quickfire** a Batarang (regular Batarang, Remote Control Batarang, or Sonic Batarang), the state you are in is "stored" on that gadget (for example, if you aim the Sonic Batarang on a corner, you now have "corner storage" on the Sonic Batarang). This is a very important concept that a lot of the major glitches in this game depend on. With an animation cancel (explained below), you can "activate" this storage, and this storage state is what enables a lot of the major glitches described below.

# REC Storage
Getting and activating storage for the REC works a little differently than other gadgets, but this is the basic step for activating storage on other gadgets so we have to start here.

To get REC storage, select the REC, aim with <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, shoot with either <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Xbox_Right_Trigger.svg" alt="Right Trigger" class="controllerButton"> or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton">, and very quickly switch to any other gadget (usually Explosive Gel). If you want to be sure if it worked or not, try quickfiring the REC. If you are able to quickfire the REC, you do not have REC storage, so try again. If you can’t quickfire and are still able to move around as Batman, you have “Light Storage”. If Batman is completely locked up and cannot move, you have “Full Storage”.

Now, activating this REC storage is very simple. All you have to do is, select any gadget other than the REC, hold <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton"> to aim, then, while still holding aim, switch to the REC. If you had REC storage, Batman should switch into whatever state you had storage for when he pulls out the REC.

# Activating Storage
To activate storage you’ve gotten for other gadgets, basically you do the same input you do to get Full REC storage, then hold Aim and switch to that gadget. So, select the REC, aim with <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, shoot with either <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Xbox_Right_Trigger.svg" alt="Right Trigger" class="controllerButton"> or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton">, and very quickly switch to another gadget (not the one you have storage for). Then, if Batman is locked up and cannot move, aim and switch to the gadget you have storage for.

You can get storage on the following gadgets:  
• Batarang  
• Sonic Batarang  
• Remote Control Batarang  

# Storage Zips
Now that you know everything else, these are pretty straightforward. You get storage on a zip-capable state and gadget, activate that storage, and then simply use the gadget you have storage on.

# Freeze Grenade Climbing
This is functionally similar to how we set up storage zips, but has a different effect. As you may know, if you stand on the edge of a railing and start throwing freeze grenades, Batman will be pushed up into the air. To be able to do this anywhere, you simply get storage on a railing, activate it, and then start throwing freeze grenades.

# REC Jumps
If you dive-roll off a ledge, Batman performs a different animation than the usual dive-roll animation. Interrupting this animation with the REC gives you a lot of height.

The inputs for this are very similar to door cancels with the REC. To dive-roll you normally press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> twice. So to interrupt a dive-roll, you press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton">, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Xbox_Right_Trigger.svg" alt="Right Trigger" class="controllerButton">, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton">. If done while standing anywhere, Batman will do this awkward animation that doesn’t accomplish anything, but if done at a ledge Batman will launch into the air.

# Gel Warp
For this trick, you’re interrupting the animation of quickfiring Explosive Gel. If you do this, instead of the gel going where it’s supposed to go directly under you, it will attempt to travel to the last position where you placed gel.

To do this, first you need to place Explosive Gel somewhere, and then blow it up. Then, select the REC, hold aim with <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, shoot with either <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Xbox_Right_Trigger.svg" alt="Right Trigger" class="controllerButton"> or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton">, and press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Xbox_button_X.svg" alt="X" class="controllerButton"> to quickfire explosive gel. If timed correctly, the gel should warp back to the first position you placed it in.

If you’re having a lot of trouble getting the warp, try slowing down the inputs a bit. There’s a bit of a delay between shooting REC and placing the gel, and this delay is essential.

This is useful in one place, during the Museum to skip the “Sickle” miniboss fight. The setup for this is very important, a lot of people have found different ways of doing this, but this is what works for me. You want to place gel on the right side of the wall (exact positioning is not important). Then, you want to go to the left side of the wall, have Batman walking into the corner between the wall and the display case but keep the camera pointing straight on. Then do the gel warp inputs.

If the gel doesn’t warp, then the timing of your inputs was off. If the gel warps, but not onto the wall, then your setup wasn’t quite right.
