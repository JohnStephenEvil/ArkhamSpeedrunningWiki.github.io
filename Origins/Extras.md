# Arkham Origins - Useless Glitches

## Sonic Batarang
If you throw a Sonic Batarang at a floor grate, it will fail to land, and you will immediately be able to throw it again.

## Ghost/Zombie Thugs
Occasionally, in preditor rooms, thugs you've taken down will still be up, walking around. This typically happens when you Batclaw a thug from a ledge just as he begins an animation. [Example](https://youtu.be/CQhDvyXNeiA)

## Croc
During the Croc fight, specifically on the PC version of the game, if Croc goes near the fence, left of the explosive tanks, the game can break in several ways, including loss of sound, loss of picture, and Croc being affected. [Example 1](https://youtu.be/zLilRARB4MQ), [Example 2](https://youtu.be/__mmXAwJmkw)

## Fast Travel
When using fast travel, sometimes there will be no sound during the cutscene. This has no effect on gameplay and the sound returns once you're back in the game.   
In rare cases, you can get an infinite fast travel. When that happens, you must close the game.

## Interrogations
Frequently, interrogation targets will be knocked out as if they are regular thugs, and will force you to reload checkpoint to progress.

## Cold, Cold Heart - My Alibi
When you enter the back room of My Alibi to interrogate Loose Lips, sometimes the room will deload. You can perform the interrogation, however you cannot leave My Alibi with the room deloaded. To fix this, you can simply cancel the door to the back room, or reload checkpoint.

## Pause Menu
If you reload checkpoint, then open any sub menu as the game is fading out, the game consistently crashes. This is only possible with mouse, as keyboard and controller inputs are disabled after confirming the reload.

## GCPD Glitched Door
In the GCPD, the door leading from the "Shooting Range" to "GCPD - Investigations" occasionally breaks and Batman will not go through when interacting with it. Simply interacting with it again should allow you to progress. [Example](https://clips.twitch.tv/DoubtfulCautiousWaffleRedCoat)
