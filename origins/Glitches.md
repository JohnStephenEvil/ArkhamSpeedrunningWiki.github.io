# Arkham Origins - Glitches

## Ground Takedown Cancels (aka Quickfire Batclaw Cancels)
You can cancel out of some animations (most notably **Ground Takedowns**) by mashing the **Quickfire Batclaw** (<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton"> + <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Xbox_button_Y.svg" alt="Y" class="controllerButton">) inputs on controller.  

These animations include, but are not limited to:
- Ground Takedowns (specifically ones with Batman jumping into the air)
- Aerial Takedowns (this is not useful *or* recommended)
- Combo Takedowns (this is not useful *or* recommended)

You can also spam other actions at the same time as Quickfire Batclaw, which allows you to do that action instead (though this guarantees that you will lose your combo).  

Confirmed things this can be done with:
- Quickfire Explosive Gel
- Dive-rolling

Ground Takedown Cancels can be made possible on keyboard and mouse through the use of an .ini file edit, however this is not allowed in speedruns.

## Door Cancelling
You can interrupt many animations, the most useful of which being the opening of doors, by using the alternate fire feature of a gadget at the same time that you start an animation.  
To do this on a door, press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton"> and <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> all on the same frame (default keyboard inputs are Right Mouse Button, Middle Mouse Button, and Space Bar).  
This can be quite difficult, so don't be discouraged if it takes a long time to get used to the timing. If you're firing the gadget and not opening the door, you're pressing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Space Bar) too late. If you're opening the door without using your gadget, you're either pressing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Space Bar) too early or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton"> (Middle Mouse Button) too late.  

Confirmed to work with these gadgets:
- Batarang
- Batclaw
- Multi Target Batarang
- Sonic Batarang

This same method also works with other animations, replacing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> with the relevant button.  

These animations include, but are not limited to:
- Silent Takedowns
- Countering Thugs

## Wire zips
Using the Remote Claw, attach a wire between two points. While sitting on the wire, reattach both ends and immediately zipline. While on the zipline, open and close the pause menu. Then wire walk again and the game will zip you to the origin point of the current map.

## Glue Grenade Climbing
Long believed to be impossible in this game, it turns out the Freeze Blast trick from Arkham City works in Arkham Origins, albeit somewhat differently.  

In certain spots, if you stand on the edge of a railing and start throwing Glue Grenades, Batman will be pushed up into the air. In most spots that this trick works, you will need to aim and throw a Batarang first, then immediately start spamming Glue Grenades. If you do not start gaining height, try starting again with the Batarang. If it still does not work despite your best efforts, your positioning may be wrong, or it may simply not work in the spot you're trying it.
