# Arkham Origins - Version Differences

# Framerate

All console versions of Arkham Origins run at 30fps. The PC version is uncapped by default. If Vsync is disabled, it can be capped manually using [.ini file edits](https://arkhamspeedrunningwiki.github.io/page.html?page=Guides/Origins/FPS).

# Butterfly Gliding

Butterfly gliding is PC exclusive, as it can only be done with keyboard and mouse.

# Quickfire Multibatarangs

On PC, you can bind Quickfire Multibatarangs (Gadget 4) to a keyboard input. This is heavily used in combat and predator encounters.

# Mousewheel

On the PC version, the mousewheel can be bound to ***quickfire*** gadgets. This is done through the 'Controls' settings from within the game itself without any .ini file edits.

This a list of gadgets that can be quickfired using the mousewheel:
- Batarang (Gadget 1)
- Batclaw (Gadget 2)
- Explosive Gel (Gadget 3)
- Triple Batarang (Gadget 4)
- Glue Grenade (Gadget 5)
- Smoke Bomb (Gadget 6)
- Concussion Detonator (Gadget 11)

The mousewheel can also be bound to ***select*** a specific gadget.

# Animation Cancels

All animation cancels can be done on all versions, but are theoretically easier on console due to the lower framerate.
These include:
- Door cancels
- Ground takedown cancels
- Silent takedown cancels

# Bane Hideout Glide

Bane hideout glide is more difficult to do on controller, and starting the glide from a [different location](https://youtu.be/EohKzumjvzI) is highly recommended.
