Make sure V-sync is turned off, then do the following: navigate to the "BmEngine.ini" file and open it, then scroll  til you find "MaxSmoothedFrameRate" under "[Engine.GameEngine]" the value should be -1. You can change it to whatever you want but for the speedrun we typically change it to 62. (shown in video)
