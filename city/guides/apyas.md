**TL;DR**: Spanish is the fastest language for every category *except* HQR on all versions, and Any% w/Cat specifically on the Return to Arkham version, which are fastest in French.

There are a few points in the game where playing on a different audio language results in dialog ending faster, and allowing you to progress through the game faster. You can view a [full spreadsheet detailing all known language differences here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IKkIDsWLHIBuIRkccrBSSW0kj0DUEJzlh97NLzSERkw/edit#gid=0).

# How to Change Language (PC)
Navigate to the game's configuration folder in:

[quote]"%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WB Games\Batman Arkham City GOTY\BmGame\Config\"[/quote]

and open "UserEngine.ini" in a text editor. In that file, find the line (should be line 31) that says

[quote]"Language=Int"[/quote]

and change "Int" to the language code you want. For taking advantage of the language differences, you must choose a setting that results in non-English audio, interface language only makes one minor difference. The five audio languages available are English (**Int**), German (**Deu**), Spanish (**Esn**), French (**Fra**) and Italian (**Ita**).

Here are all known language codes:  
**Int** = "International", Full English. Unrecognized language codes will default to this.
**Deu** = Full German.
**Esm** = Spanish interface, English audio.
**Esn** = Full Spanish.
**Fra** = Full French.
**Ita** = Full Italian.
**Jpn** = Japanese interface (at least in theory, the text doesn't work for me), English audio.
**Kor** = Korean interface (in theory, same deal as Jpn), English audio.
**Pol** = Polish interface, English audio.
**Por** = Portuguese interface, English audio.
**Rus** = Russian interface, English audio.
