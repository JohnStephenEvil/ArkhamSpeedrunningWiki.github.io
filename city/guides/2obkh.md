For zips to work correctly on PC, you need to run the game at 62fps, which is the default framerate without v-sync. If it's running at 60fps, you need to disable v-sync. Disable it in the game's launcher, and make sure it's not forced on by any third-party programs like Nvidia Control Panel.

You also want PhysX off, and DirectX 11 Features and Tessellation off. PhysX generally creates lag, and I have no idea what DX11 does in the game, or how it affects the speedrun, but apparently it's best to have it off.
