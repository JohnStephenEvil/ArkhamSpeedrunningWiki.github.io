So the two main programs we will need for this are called ffmpeg and Scaleform Video Encoder.  ffmpeg can be found at the following website (make sure to download the one for your system, not the source code):
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

You will also need to follow the instructions in this link to add the program to the PATH.

Finally, download and extract Scaleform Video Encoder which I uploaded here:

First you will need to convert your video to an avi video using ffmpeg.  Open command prompt and type the following command, making sure to replace the file fields with your file and wherever you would like your output to be.

ffmpeg -i "C:\Videofile.whatever" -q:v 4 "C:\Output.avi"

Now create a wave file of the audio.

ffmpeg -i "C:\Videofile.whatever" "C:\Output.wav"

Now open Scaleform Video Encoder by finding the exe in the folder.  Choose that avi file we just made and add the wave file to every audio track necessary (for Arkham City, tracks 0-4).

Remember that replacing video files is only allowed if it does not detract from the run time (for example, TV_CH8_Hello.usm in Arkham City does not change the run time).
