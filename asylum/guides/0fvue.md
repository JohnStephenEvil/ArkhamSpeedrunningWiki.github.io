This episode of TSSB is a nice introduction to the Arkham Asylum speedrunning, depicting the history of finding big skips in this game, problematic tricks that you can encounter and a lot of other tips. Great video for beginners who want to get familiar with the game. It was recorded in the April of 2015, not long after the zips were found, so it misses some of latest strats.

In this video Cojosao thoroughly explains most of the tricks in the speedrun. However, this video is from August 2014, so again, it doesn't cover zips and other newer findings. Still, it's a must see for all new runners who play more on a casual side and doesn't want to do the big sequence breaking skips yet.
