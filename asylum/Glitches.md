# Arkham Asylum - Glitches

## Animation Canceling
You can interrupt many animations, the most useful of which being the opening of doors, by using the alternate fire feature of a gadget at the same time that you start an animation.  
To do this on a door, press <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Xbox_Left_Trigger.svg" alt="Left Trigger" class="controllerButton">, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton"> and <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> all on the same frame (keyboard inputs are Right Mouse Button, Middle Mouse Button, and Space Bar).  
This can be quite difficult, so don't be discouraged if it takes a long time to get used to the timing. If you're firing the gadget and not opening the door, you're pressing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Space) too late. If you're opening the door without using your gadget, you're either pressing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> (Space) too early or <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Xbox_Right_Bumper.svg" alt="Right Bumper" class="controllerButton"> (Middle Mouse Button) too late.  

Confirmed to work with these gadgets:
- Batarang
- Explosive Gel
- Batclaw / Ultra Batclaw
- Line Launcher
- Multi-Batarang
- Sonic Batarang
- Remote Control Batarang

This same method also works with other animations, replacing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Xbox_button_A.svg" alt="A" class="controllerButton"> with the relevant button.  

These animations include, but are not limited to:
- Silent Takedowns
- Ground Takedowns
- Countering Thugs
- Gathering Spores in Croc's Lair
- Destroying Ivy's Pods

## Storage (Overview)

## Activating Storage

## Storage Zips

## Direct Zips (AKA Corner Zips)
These only exist in the v1.0 release of the game, and are basically useless.  

## Riddler Trophy Duplicating
You can pick up multiple Riddler Trophies on the same frame, giving you experience for each, as well as counting them all towards the total trophies collected.  
This can be used to trigger Riddler's final dialog early, however you still must collect every individual trophy in the game in a 100% speedrun.
