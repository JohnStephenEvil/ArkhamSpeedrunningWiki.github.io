# Arkham Knight - Glitches

## Quickfire Explosive Gel Cancels
Primarily used to skip takedown animations, this trick is very easy to perform.  
Simply quickfire the Explosive Gel, interact with something, then hold aim.  
You do not need the Explosive Gel equipped for this to work.  

This works on several animations, including, but not limited to:
- Silent Takedowns
- Combat Takedowns
- Ground Takedowns (You can start holding crouch before doing the other inputs, and continue to hold it until you have performed the cancel)
- Destroying Sentry Guns
- Dual Team Takedowns (In predator encounters, not in combat)
- Countering Thugs (Only certain animations)
- Vehicle Counters
- Grappling

## Explosive Gel Alternate Fire Cancels
You can interrupt several animations using the Explosive Gel.  
To cancel a door, have the Explosive Gel equipped while standing at the door, and...  
On controller: Aim, then release aim and press alternate fire and interact at the same time.  
On keyboard and mouse: Aim, then release aim and press alternate fire and interact at the same time, then hold aim.  

This works on several animations, including, but not limited to:
- Doors
- Yellow wire/switch boxes
- The bust inside the Clocktower
- Neutralizing agent canisters
- Hostage prompts
- Grappling

## Freeze Blast Cancels
You can interrupt several animations using the Freeze Blast.  
You simply quickfire a Freeze Blast, interact with something, then hold aim.  

This works on several animations, including, but not limited to:
- Silent Takedowns
- Combat Takedowns
- The bust inside the Clocktower
- Neutralizing agent canisters
- Grappling

## Grapple Swing Clips
While on a railing, you can grapple to another railing and Batman will swing between them.  
You can interrupt this animation, which causes Batman to sink into the floor, and this can be used to get out of bounds beneath the map.  

**Note:** How far Batman sinks into the ground is related to framerate. A lower framerate makes him sink farther down, which is what you want. Therefore, you should have your game capped at 30FPS when performing this trick.  

To perform the trick, quickfire a Freeze Blast, then grapple and hold aim. When you are beneath the map, cancel the grapple with <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Xbox_button_B.svg" alt="Controller B" class="controllerButton"> or Left Control, and be ready to glide. You can be holding the glide button during the trick so you start gliding immediately when you cancel the grapple.
