# Arkham Knight - Version Differences

# Framerate/Zips

All console versions of Arkham Knight run at 30fps by default. Framerate for the PC version cannot be capped manually from the .ini files, but there is an in-game limiter that can cap fps to 30, 60, or 90.

Zips behave differently at different framerates, however the speedrun is done at 30fps for all versions.

# Glitches

All glitches are possible on all versions, with the exception of rail zips.  
Rail zips are possible anywhere in the game on PC. However, they can only be performed in certain spots on console due to the controls overlapping.  
Regardless of this, rail zips are not used in the currrent route, so the route is identical on all versions.

# Gliding

Gliding is *significantly* easier while using keyboard and mouse, and offers greater precision than is available with a controller. Though, all glides can be done on a controller.

Proper divebombing will let you gain height, if done correctly, you can keep gaining height infinitely. In theory, this should be easy to do, but in practice it is much harder to pull off, *especially* on a controller.

Gliding towards a level will auto-adjust and boost Batman's height (This is more noticable while OoB), making it very useful in case you lose too much height and need to recover.

Some Extra Notes:
- Holding the aim button while gliding will move the camera up.
- Falling is faster than divebombing.

# ACE Chemicals: Neutralizing Agents

If you cancel the animation of picking up the neutralizing agents, you *can* run while holding them. However, when running on controller you must only push the stick halfway. Attempting to move at full running speed will cause the canister to explode.

# Alfred's Analysis

After Gordon gets in the batmobile Alfred will give you an analysis of the Arkham Knight's forces, his dialogue can only be skipped on keyboard.

# Switching Gadgets

Due to the introduction of the 'Gadget Wheel', switching gadgets is slower and much less convenient on controller.
